### Library Management System 

**Problem Statement**: The library management system is currently operating manually, leading to issues such as slow retrieval of books, difficulty in tracking book availability and library activity, and delayed book returns. To address these issues, a software system is required that can automate the library's operations and provide a more efficient and streamlined experience for both librarians and patrons.

**1. Introduction**:

**1.1 Purpose of this Document**: The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive outline of the requirements for developing a library management software system. The document will describe the system's scope, functions, and non-functional attributes, as well as any design constraints, performance requirements, and interface requirements.

**1.2 Scope of this Document**: This document will provide a clear understanding of the software system's objectives and features, including how it will benefit users and the library community as a whole. It will also describe the development cost and time required for the project.

**1.3 Overview**: The library management software system is a digital platform designed to streamline and improve library operations. It will allow librarians to manage the library's resources, including books, journals, and multimedia materials, and help library patrons to find and access library resources easily.

**2. General Description**: The software system aims to provide librarians with a user-friendly, efficient platform that can help them manage library resources efficiently, including tracking library materials, processing loan requests, and managing the library's digital resources. The system will also provide patrons with an easy-to-use platform to find 
library resources, reserve materials, and renew items. The system is designed for library staff, librarians, and patrons who have basic computer knowledge. The library management software system will offer several features such as managing library resources, tracking library materials, processing loan requests, managing the library's digital resources,
reserving materials, renewing items, managing patron accounts, and generating reports.

**3. Functional Requirements**: The functional requirements of the library management software system are:

i. manage library resources, including books, journals, and multimedia materials

ii. track library materials and their location within the library

iii. process loan requests from patrons

iv. manage the library's digital resources, including eBooks and digital journals

v. allow patrons to reserve materials and renew items

vi. manage patron accounts

vii. generate reports

**4. Interface Requirements**: The library management software system must have the following interfaces:

i. A user interface for library staff and librarians to manage library resources, including tracking and processing loan requests

ii. A user interface for patrons to search and access library resources and manage their accounts

iii. A database to store library resources, patron information, and loan requests

**5. Performance Requirements**: The library management software system must perform the following functions:

i. The system must be fast and responsive when searching for library resources and processing loan requests

ii. The system must be able to handle multiple users concurrently

iii. The system must be able to maintain data integrity and security

**6. Design Constraints**: The library management software system must be developed using the following design constraints:

i. The system must use a web-based architecture

ii. The system must be developed using any programming language

iii. The system must be designed to run on Windows and macOS platforms

**7. Non-Functional Attributes**: The library management software system must meet the following non-functional attributes:

i. Security: The system must be secure, protecting patron data and library resources

ii. Reliability: The system must be reliable and function without errors

iii. Scalability: The system must be scalable to meet the needs of growing libraries

**8. Preliminary Schedule and Budget**: The preliminary schedule and budget for the library management software system will depend on various factors, such as the
complexity of the system, the number of features required, and the size of the development team. The schedule will include the estimated 
time required for each phase of the development process, such as requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment. The budget 
will cover the costs associated with software development, such as salaries, hardware and software expenses, and any other relevant expenses.
